1. There will be race conditions on HashTable Entries. Incase two thread execute function insert()
   concurrently if one thread break the invariant of the HashTable Entry and the other thread
   update the Entries at that time, the data structure will be messed up which leads to the
   missing of the keys.
2. thread 1: Read Table[i]; ->
   thread 2: Read Table[i]; ->
   thread 1: e->next = Table[i]; ->
   thread 2: e->next = Table[i]; ->
   thread 1: *p = e; ->
   thread 2: *p = e; (the key inserted by thread 1 is missed.)
